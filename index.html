            <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was
                co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists
                Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated
                March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man (May 1968). Also in 1963, the character founded
                the Avengers alongside Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.</p>

                <h3> Premiere</h3>
                <p>Iron Man's Marvel Comics premiere in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963) was a
                    collaboration among editor and story-plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, story-artist Don Heck,
                    and cover-artist and character-designer Jack Kirby. In 1963, Lee had been toying with the idea of a
                    businessman superhero. He wanted to create the "quintessential capitalist", a character that would
                    go against the spirit of the times and Marvel's readership.</p>

                <h3> Themes</h3>
                <p>The original Iron Man title explored Cold War themes, as did other Stan Lee projects in the early
                    years of Marvel Comics. Where The Fantastic Four and The Incredible Hulk respectively focused on
                    American domestic and government responses to the Communist threat, Iron Man explored industry's
                    role in the struggle. Tony Stark's real-life model, Howard Hughes, was a significant defense
                    contractor who developed new weapons technologies. Hughes was an icon both of American individualism
                    and of the burdens of fame.</p>

                <h3> Solo series</h3>
                <p>After issue #99 (March 1968), the Tales of Suspense series was renamed Captain America. An Iron Man
                    story appeared in the one-shot comic Iron Man and Sub-Mariner (April 1968), before the "Golden
                    Avenger" made his solo debut with Iron Man (May 1968). The series's indicia gives its copyright
                    title Iron Man, while the trademarked cover logo of most issues is The Invincible Iron Man.</p>

            <p>Stark expands on his armor designs and begins to build his arsenal of specialized armors for particular
                situations such as for space travel[39] and stealth. Stark also develops a serious dependency on alcohol
                in the "Demon in a Bottle" storyline. The first time it becomes a problem is when Stark discovers that
                the national security agency S.H.I.E.L.D. has been buying a controlling interest in his company in order
                to ensure Stark's continued weapons development for them. At the same time, it is revealed that several
                minor supervillains armed with advanced weapons who had bedeviled Stark throughout his superhero career
                are in fact in the employ of Stark's business rival, Justin Hammer, who begins to plague Stark more
                directly.</p>
